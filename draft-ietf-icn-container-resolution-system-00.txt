          Content and Container Name Resolution System in ICN
          draft-ietf-icnrg-icn-container-resolution-system-00


Abstract

   We illustrate the architecture and mechanism of content and container
   name resolution system, and the protocol of resolving content and
   container names in ICN. The fundamental characters are:1)Use Interest
   and Data packet as the communication primitives, 2)Every routing node
   has FIB, CS, PIT tables to do packet routing and caching. Current
   NDN/CCN architecture does not require a resolution system. The
   routing is totally based on prefixes of content names, which causes
   scalability and mobility issues described in [Cisco-Name]. This draft
   addresses the aforementioned issues.

1  Content and Container Name Resolution System

1.1  Introduction 

   This draft is the companion to [Huawei-name] and illustrates the
   content name and container resolution system (hereinafter referred to
   as NRS). The NRS assists the routing requirement of the container,
   which is the extension  of conventional Information Centric
   Networking (hereinafter referred to as ICN) naming.

1.2. System Architecture

   An NRS is composed by a number of distributed content and container
   name systems (hereinafter referred to as CNS) deployed in an ICN
   network. CNS maintains the mapping from content names or containers
   to their access containers. The concept of container, container name,
   container set , container assisted routing, resolvable container
   name, and access container are described in [Huawei-name]. The
   following figure illustrates the high level CNS architecture.

                                Network/Container A
                                 +-----------------+
                                 |     +------+    |
                                 |     | CNS  |    |
                                 |     +------+    |
                                 +-----------------+
                                          Network/Container C      
                                        +-----------------+
                   Network/Container B  |     +------+    |
                   +-----------------+  |     | CNS  |    |
                   |     +------+    |  |     +------+    |
                   |     | CNS  |    |  +-----------------+
                   |     +------+    |                     
                   +-----------------+                     
                      Figure 1 System Architecture
   For each content name and container name, there is an authoritative
   CNS (hereinafter referred to as A-CNS) acting as its final name
   resolution provider. One container can have an A-CNS for multiple
   containers.  Other CNS can identify the A-CNS of a content name or
   container with one of the following methods:

   -Use the A-CNS indicator included in the content request packet.

   -Use category tree hierarchy similar to current DNS, and configure an
   A-CNS for each container.

   -Leverage container assisted ICN routing mechanism to identify the A-
   CNS of the container.

INTERNET DRAFT             ICN-Naming-Routing           October 21, 2013


   Since containers are part of the hierarchical tree or DAG of a
   content name, they have to know their predecessor and successor(s) in
   the tree or DAG [Huawei-name]. Thus CNS within a container has the
   similar knowledge of its predecessor and successor(s). If a CNS of a
   container cannot locate the A-CNS of a content name or container, it
   asks the help from its upper level CNS.

   Registration and unregistration operation of a content name or
   container has to be done on its A-CNS. Other CNS, for example the CNS
   for the local access container, proxies the registration and
   unregisration requests to the A-CNS. In other words, the final
   resolution result of a content name or container must come from its
   A-CNS. For any resolution request, if an intermediate CNS has the
   result cached, then it can reply directly, otherwise this CNS has to
   forward the request to its A-CNS, and caches the resolution result
   according to the predefined policy.

1.3. System Components of CNS

   CNS has 3 components, DataBase (hereinafter referred to as DB),
   Execution Engine, and Network interfaces.

   Database stores resolution related data. Implementation details can
   leverage current DB technologies or file systems.

   Execution engine is responsible for processing resolution related
   logic. It analyzes packet from network interface, operates on DB, and
   sends operation result out of Network interfaces.

   Network interfaces sends/receives ICN packets according to ICN

   protocols. It receives Interest packet from client, end device,
   network node, service or other CNS, and sends packet to the execution
   engine for further processing. It forwards Data packet by following
   the instruction from execution engine.

2  Resolution Scheme

2.1  Content Name Composition

   We propose to reserve a few keywords in ICN for the resolution
   operations. They are RESOLVE\REGISTER\UNREGISTER, representing 3
   primitive operations: as inquiry, registration and unregistration,
   respectively. Keywords are configured automatically or manually
   during ICN joining into the network.

   Once a CNS with resolution capability joins into ICN, it publishes
   aforementioned keywords(RESOLVE\ REGISTER \ UNREGISTER) according to
   the ICN rules. Any ICN node who receives the published packet will
   add table entries associated with those keywords to its FIB. All
   those entries point to the CNS.

   We then prefix resolution keyword to the content ID that requires
   resolution to be the new content ID of ICN packet (Interest/Data).
   Since each node in ICN use LPM to lookup FIB for forwarding, any
   match of the keyword will route the resolution request to the
   aforementioned CNS.

   We can also use container assisted resolution to route packet to a
   CNS. In this case, CNS publishes the name of the container that it
   resides in [super container] to ICN according to ICN rules. Any node
   in ICN will add routes accordingly. We can use the routing protocol
   described in draft [Huawei-name] to route interest to CNS by adding
   super container name as the suffix to aforementioned Content ID.

   For example, CNS has published that it resides in the super container
   named RESOLVER to the ICN. The interest to inquiry
   "chinamobile/johndoe" can be composed as
   "RESOLVE/chinamobile/johndoe|RESOLVER".

   Furthermore, the "resolver" field included in the content name can be
   used to explicitly indicate the name of the desired A-CNS. Therefore,
   a resolution request can be generated according to the name of the A-
   CNS and routed to the A-CNS directly. The name of the resolution
   request can be formatted as "/Name of the A-CNS/RESOLVE/the content
   name". For example, if the the A-CNS of a content name
   "chinamobile/johndoe/blog" is "chinamobile/resolver", a resolution
   request with name
   "/chinamobile/resolver/RESOLVE/chinamobile/johndoe/blog" can be

   generated, and further routed directly to the A-CNS
   "chinamobile/resolver" by name because of the name prefix routing.

2.2. Name Registration

   The registration operation utilizes ICN protocol's Interest packet to
   carry the request, and uses Data packet to carry the reply
   (resolution result).


   In details, information of content or container A registration
   includes: "replace (Yes/No){access provider Container B/Container set
   C with its properties (attributes)}", for example: "(
   replace=yes;){cn/gd/sz ; TTL =100 | hostsrv.com;  resolvable=yes; TTL
   =5000; }". Where:

   -Value of Replace field can be Yes or No (True/False?) If content or
   container A exists in CNS,

   --If Replace value is No: Insert the new resolution result to the
   front of result list. If container B or container set C has already
   existed in CNS, then delete the old result.

   --If replace value is Yes: Directly replace the existing resolution
   result with the new one.

   --By default, "replace=no", even with the absence of REPLACE field.

   --Example one: "REGISTER/chinamobile/johndoe" ->"(
   replace=yes;){cn/gd/sz ; TTL =100 | hostsrv.com;  resolvable=yes; TTL
   =5000; }"  For now, original resolution result of
   "chinamobile/johndoe" will be invalid and will be replaced by
   "cn/gd/sz" and "hostsrv.com"

   --Example Two: "Name of A-CNS/REGISTER /chinamobile /johndoe /blog
   /CONTAINER /( replace=yes;){cn/gd/sz ; TTL =100 | hostsrv.com; 
   resolvable=yes; TTL =5000; }". In this case, the A-CNS of the
   specific content name /chinamobile/johndoe/blog is given, therefore
   it is used as the prefix of the resolution requests name. The keyword
   "REGISTER" is used to indicate the type of the message.

   -Resolvable value (Yes/No): Whether the resolution result (container
   B/container set C) can be resolved again. The operation of recursive
   resolution can be seen as the expansion of resolution results. The
   expansion resolution can be done when writing to Database, or when
   resolution system idling, or when receiving a resolution request.

   -(Optional) TTL (Unit Second): Time of the resolution result can be

   cached. The result will not be cached if this value is 0.

   Registration information can be put into Selector field. A new
   property, RESOLVE is added to represent name solution (see Figure 3)
   to hold register and unregister information.

   In the Data packet, it also carries the success or failure
   information of the registration operation. In this reply Data packet,
   the "signed info" field has to set as "no caching" (This is
   implementation dependent), this setting ensures upcoming Interest
   requests will not be replied by the intermediaries but the CNS.

   Aforementioned content name register and unregister information , it
   can be put directly into content name field rather than in Selector
   field. The whole content name will be composed of content ID and
   content name register/unregister information. As illustrated in
   Figure 4.

   Furthermore, we could also put the composed registration request name
   with A-CNS name as prefix into the content name field. The whole
   content include the A-CNS name, the content ID and also the access
   container of the content ID. As illustrated in Figure 5.

2.3 Name unregistration

   The purpose of this operation is to unregister the access container
   B/container set C for content or container A. In other words,
   container B/container set C is removed or voided from content or
   container A's resolution result list. This operation piggybacks on
   ICN protocol's Interest packet to carry the request, and leverages
   Data packet to carry the reply.

   In details, the unregistration information of a container name looks
   like: "{access provider container B/container set C}". For example,
   "{cn/gd/sz ; | hostsrv.com;}". This information is in the new added
   properties in Selector field similar to that of registration
   operation. Otherwise, if the A-CNS of a content is given, then name
   of the unregistration request can be composed as "Name of A-
   CNS/UNREGISTER /chinamobile /johndoe /blog /CONTAINER /(cn/gd/sz ; |
   hostsrv.com; }"


   -If content or container A does not exist in CNS, or there is no
   aforementioned container B/container set C as the resolution result
   of content or container A, then CNS replies failure status.

   -If there are resolution results, remove them from CNS.

   -If all resolution results are removed successfully, then reply
   "total success", otherwise, reply "partial success" with failed
   portions and reasons. The common reason is "non-exist".

   -If resolution result of content or container A does not exist, then
   remove container A from CNS. The operation result will be carried
   back by Data Packet similar to that of registration. The Data Packet
   will be set as uncacheable.

2.4. Name resolution

   The purpose of this operation is to obtain container B/container set
   C which provides access service for content or container A. This
   operation utilizes ICN protocol Interest Packet to carry the request,

   and Data packet to carry the resolution result.

   In details, the carried packet has to include content or container
   name A. For example "chinamobile/johndoe/blog" or
   "chinamobile/johndoe"


   The resolution result is carried back by Data packet in the Data

   us/ca", CNS will do the following:
   -If content or container name A does not exist in the CNS, then
   replies "failed" or NULL.

   -Return the resolution result of content or container A in order. If
   the result container name has the "resolvable=yes" property, then it
   can be further resolved. The resolution results can be inserted in
   the original result by following the method described in [Huawei-
   name]

   -If the result has TTL property, the caching timer at Signed Info
   field of Data packet (implementation details may be different, for
   example, in CCN, it is FreshnessSecond, in NDN it is staletime) will
   be set as the minimum of TTL (in previous example, it is 1000)

   -The intermediaries ICN nodes can cache the resolution results in its
   Content Store (hereinafter referred to as CS). Cache Time can be
   processed according to ICN rules. Request packet is shown in Figure
   6.

3 Implementation of CNS

   Aforementioned CNS is based on ICN node (support ICN protocol at
   lower level). It is responsible for name registration and resolution.
   It can be part of a resolution system together with other CNS'.

   Any end device/network device/service can register its access
   container/container set in the CNS to enable other devices and
   services to inquiry them. Meanwhile, it has the capability to work
   seamlessly with other CNS.

   As illustrated by Figure 10, John Doe applied a personal domain name
   "chinamobile/johndoe", China Mobile provides access service for him.
   Current access location is Shenzhen, Guangdong. Thus he registered
   the container as "cn/gd/sz"; the same user applied a third party
   (Hostsrv) to provide him with service. The name of the specific
   access container of the service can be obtained via resolution lookup
   (For example, Hostsrv provides 3 DCs for John Doe at "cn/gd",
   "cn/Beijing", and "us/ca"). Thus the container is registered as
   "hostsrv.com resolvable=yes". Once ICN receives Interest packet with
   name "chinamobile/johndoe", it sends resolution request to CNS. After
   two iterations of resolutions, NRS returns the resolution results.

   Another implementation method is to return the direct resolution
   result. If client wants to resolve the resolvable container, then it
   can send another resolution request. Figure 11 illustrates the
   procedure.

4 Execution Engine Process Logic

   Detailed steps:
   1.Is the receiving packet Interest packet or Data packet? If it is
   interest packet, go to step 2, otherwise, go to step 10.
   2.Check operation type. If it is "register/unregister" type, then go
   to step 3. If it is "resolve" type, then go to step 8
   3.Use this node as A-CNS? Yes, go to step 4, otherwise go to step 9.
   4.If it is "register" type, go to step 5, otherwise remove content
   or container names identified by Interest packet from the result 
   list, go to step 12.
   5.If the content or container name about to register exists, go to
   step 6, otherwise, add new name and associated resolution results to
   Table. Generate Data packet with successful status, go to 
   step 7.
   6.
   i.If "replace=true", then replace the existing resolution results
   with the ones carried from interest packet, generate Data packet with
   successful status, go to step 7.
   ii.If "replace=false" or no replace property, then insert resolution
   results from interest packet to the front of the container list. If

   container name in interest packet is the same as of old resolution
   results, remove original associated table entry. Generate Data packet
   with successful status, go to step 7.
   7.(This optional step can be skipped and directly go to step 12).
   Traverse resolution results; index all resolvable containers. If a
   resolvable container can't be resolved locally, then route Interest
   packet to the next level CNS or A-CNS of the container name. Wait for
   result carried back by Data packet. If the result is NULL, this
   container name cannot be resolved. Return failure status in Data
   packet, otherwise, create index to the next level resolution.
   Generate a complete Data packet with resolution results from all
   iterations, go to step 12.
   8.
     i.Does container name exist in the table? If not, then go to step
   9. If yes, then traverse all resolution results, insert generated
   Data packet. Go to step 12 after all results have been checked.
     ii.(Optional Step) If some of the results are resolvable
   ("resolvable=yes"), then resolve the container recursively by using
   this step. If the same result has been resolved (the same container
   name has been packaged into Data Packet), then ignore the result, and
   keep the traverse the next item (container name).
   9.Append container name of next level CNS or A-CNS to the content ID
   in Interest Packet per preset policy. If there is a container name
   associated to the node, remove it. Generate a new Interest packet and
   route it out, and waiting for the returning Data packet.
   10.If the reply Data packet is for register/unregister request,
   forward Data packet to the original requester, go to step 12. If the
   reply Data packet is for resolution request, go to 11.
   11.Create table entry per the content ID (container name in this
   context) and resolution result within the Data packet, If the same
   container name exists, replace or remove it from the table per the
   preset rules. Generate Data packet based on local table results. If
   resolution result is NULL then no table entry is created. If this
   resolution is triggered by previous REGISTER resolution, go to step
   7, otherwise, it is caused by RESOLVE resolution, go to step 6.
   12.Call network interface module to forward Interest or Data packet.
