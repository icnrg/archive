Internet-Draft            BGP URI advertisement                July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The IRTF ICNRG working group is chartered to investigate subjects
   relating to information-centric networking.  Within this field, the
   Named Data Networking (NDN) scheme proposes the use of content names
   for data objects.  NDN data objecs are identified by an unambiguous
   content name, and NDN packets do not have traditional source or
   destination host addresses.  NDN proposes to use IP routing protocols
   such as OSPF and BGP in order to disseminate routes towards content
   throughout the network, in much the same way that these protocols
   disseminate routes towards IP prefixes today.

   Separately, HTTP CDNs would like to use IP routing to carry
   reachability information about content availability.  This allows
   CDNs to discover paths to content the same way as IP paths are
   discovered (as opposed to the current model of statically
   provisioning forests of trees).  We propose to use BGP to carry a
   binding of <Content-prefix,server> which will allow cache nodes to
   discover origins of content and therefore paths through the network
   to this content.


2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document:

      NDN: Named Data Networking project (http://named-data.net)

      CCN: Content-Centric Networking; often a synonym of Named Data
      Networking

      CDN: Content Delivery Network


3.  Requirements

   The broad requirement is to carry content URIs in BGP in order to
   advertise the ability to reach the content represented by these URIs.
   Following are two specific use cases for these requirements.

3.1.  Named Data Networking

   An NDN client issues an Interest packet with a data object name in it
   to indicate that it wishes to receive the data object with that name.
   NDN routers follow their forwarding table (or FIB) in order to route
   the interest packet towards a source of that data.  Once the interest
   is received by a node which has a copy of the data being requested,
   the data packet is returned.  The interest lays down a breadcrumb



Narayanan, et al.       Expires January 29, 2013                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft            BGP URI advertisement                July 2012


   trail in the Pending Interest Table (PIT) on all routers along the
   path, which is unwound to forward the data packet.  Therefore, the
   job of a NDN router FIB is to contain only routes to content, not
   devices (neither servers nor clients).  By extension, the use of
   routing protocols to populate this FIB implies that the function of
   routing protocols in NDN is to carry routes towards content.

   In NDN, object names consist of a hierarchically structured set of
   components.  Each component is composed of a number of arbitrary
   octets.  A named interest lookup in the FIB matches a routing prefix
   if the complete set of components in the prefix match the beginning
   set of components in the name.  Partial component matches are not
   permitted, and neither are matches from components inside the name.

3.2.  Intelligent CDN

   An HTTP cache node receives HTTP requests from a downstream cache or
   client for an object, specified by a URL.  If the object is present
   in local cache, it is delivered downstream via HTTP/TCP to the
   requestor.  Otherwise, the cache node may either issue an error or
   redirect back to the requestor, but more commonly keeps the request
   in abeyance and issues its own request for that content object to an
   upstream cache node.  This chain continues until the request reaches
   the origin server where it can either be authoritatively served or
   denied.  Once the content is located, the trail of pending HTTP
   requests unwinds until the content reaches the client.

   One problem to be solved in this scheme is, which upstream node does
   the cache issue its request to, and how does it discover this node?
   Current CDN implementations use private configuration & provisioning
   mechanisms to build static or dynamic "CDN trees".  However, the
   problem can be restated as follows: a CDN node needs to locate the
   closest/best CDN node on the path from it to an origin of the content
   it is looking for.  This problem is isomorphic to the NDN routing
   problem described above, and the solution is also the same: have CDN
   nodes implement a "cache FIB" which matches URL requests against a
   URL prefix table, and directs requests matching entries in the table
   to their corresponding "next-hops" which in this case are upstream
   CDN nodes.  Given this description, the use of routing protocols like
   BGP and OSPF suggests itself as a mechanism to populate this cache
   FIB.


4.  Common BGP Solution

   These two requirements have much in common.  In both cases, a content
   name prefix is to be carried as an NLRI to build a content prefix FIB
   on intermediate routers.  Both applications may utilize sophisticated



Narayanan, et al.       Expires January 29, 2013                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            BGP URI advertisement                July 2012


   policy to guide the selection of the best upstream node.  Content FIB
   matching is done on componentized longest prefix match.  Both
   applications would like the benefits of dynamic routing -- vendor-
   independent, no requirement of static cache trees, handles multiple
   content sources well, handles link and node outages and reconverges
   quickly, etc.

   To this end, we propose a single solution for both these problems.
   The proposal is to carry URIs as an NLRI in BGP.  The type of the URI
   will discriminate between applications and also provide some
   information about the type of content and access protocol.  URI-NLRIs
   are treated exactly the same as IPv4 NLRIs from a matching and rules
   processing perspective.  The result is a distributed RIB and a local
   FIB which contains the best routes (next-hops) towards different
   groups of content which identify the same prefix.

   The use of URIs as defined in [RFC3986] is proposed to carry routes
   in BGP.  A new AF type called Content-URI is defined, which carries a
   URI that indicates the source of some content.  The semantic of the
   Content-URI NLRI is basically the same as that of other NLRIs like
   IPv4, namely that a receipt of an advertisement with a Content-URI
   NLRI defines the path towards content matching the prefix in Content-
   URI. (in NEXT_HOP, AS_ORIGIN and AS_PATH attributes).  A BGP speaker
   who issues a Content-URI NLRI must either store the content matching
   that URI, or know how to reach it (perhaps based on receipt of the
   same prefix from an upstream BGP speaker).  Existing BGP attributes
   will be supported with this new NLRI, and also new ICN-specific
   attributes will be defined for this purpose.

   We define a new BGP Capability [RFC3392] that indicates the ability
   of a node to support Content-URI AF.  Only BGP speakers who exchange
   this "Content-URI-Capability" will be permitted to emit and/or
   receive Content-URI NLRIs.  Specifically, a node that does not
   receive Content-URI-Capability from its BGP peer MUST NOT forward any
   NLRIs with Content-URI AF to those neighbors (this may be overridden
   by policy).

   A node advertises a Content-URI NLRI to indicate reachability to all
   known content under that URI prefix.  Typically these NLRIs will be
   originated at origin servers, or nodes that act as origin proxies.
   BGP speakers MUST NOT originate Content-URI NLRIs simply if they have
   some content under that URI prefix cached, unless they know that they
   can retrieve the rest from upstream; this is typically configured by
   policy for origin proxies or virtual origin servers.

   As with other address families, Content-URI NLRIs populate a RIB with
   Content-URI addresses.  These do not intersect with NLRIs from other
   address families such as IPv4.  However, attributes such as NEXT_HOP



Narayanan, et al.       Expires January 29, 2013                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            BGP URI advertisement                July 2012


   will continue to be of type IPv4 or IPv6, and these may require
   matching IPv4/IPv6 NLRIs in order to achieve reachability to the next
   hop.

4.1.  URI Details

   This section presents some of the details with URI handling in BGP.

   NDN name prefixes are not strict subsets of URIs because the
   component separator is not the same as specified in [RFC3986] and NDN
   names can contain arbitrary octets.  [RFC3986] specifies that URIs
   can only consist of a limited set of alphabets, digits and symbols,
   and describes Percent-Encoding as a mechanism to encode arbitrary
   octets in URIs.  NDN prefixes will be encoded using '/' as the
   component separator and percent encoding to carry all octets beyond
   the limited set supported by URIs.  URLs used in HTTP CDNs are a
   strict subset of URIs and require no translation to be carried in a
   Content-URI NLRI.

   URI prefix length is implicitly signaled to be the length of the
   entire URI string in the NLRI.  All URIs MUST contain a valid URL
   scheme or URN namespace.  A default (zero-length prefix) route is one
   which contains only the URL scheme/URN namespace (e.g. "http://" or
   "ccn:").  BGP implementations which receive Content-URI
   advertisements which do not satisfy these requirements MUST discard
   these advertisements.  The URL scheme/URN namespace defines both the
   prefix matching rules and content retrieval rules.

   There is no requirement that NEXT_HOP addresses actually be located
   on the BGP router.  For example, BGP advertisements can be
   distributed by a router infrastructure on behalf of a CDN network,
   with the NEXT_HOP for Content-URI advertisements pointing to a CDN
   node.  In this scenario, it is important that BGP also distribute
   IPv4 NLRIs as required to ensure reachability to these CDN node
   addresses.

4.2.  Example of URLs (HTTP)

   If the URI advertised is a URL, it includes a scheme which describes
   the mechanism to retrieve this content, and also a location where
   this content is present.  BGP speakers who originate URL-type routes
   must support the scheme indicated in the URL.  The NEXT_HOP attribute
   is used to identify an alternate location to retrieve the content.
   For example, if a BGP speaker publishes a Content-URI with a HTTP
   URL, it must:






Narayanan, et al.       Expires January 29, 2013                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            BGP URI advertisement                July 2012


   1.  Support the HTTP protocol, as a HTTP proxy [RFC2616]

   2.  Receive HTTP connections on the address it advertises as NEXT_HOP

   3.  Be able to either locally deliver or remotely retrieve content
       matching the prefix

   A BGP speaker receiving a Content-URI advertisement with an HTTP URL
   knows that an upstream CDN candidate with the specified IP address
   from NEXT_HOP can be used to retrieve this content.  On receiving
   this advertisement, the CDN node can use this information to
   construct its CDN tree for this content prefix.  For URL matching,
   the entire prefix must match the beginning of the

   The CDN node MUST use only the protocol specified in the URL scheme
   to retrieve the object; no other protocol may be assumed to be
   supported without external configuration.  For example, an
   advertisement for a "http://" URL implies that the NEXT_HOP node
   supports only HTTP, not HTTPS or SPDY.  Alternative protocols are
   supported through advertising multiple URLs with different scheme
   (but see below for an alternative solution).

4.3.  Example of URNs (NDN)

   If the URI is of URN form, it does not identify a scheme or locator,
   but rather a namespace prefix.  BGP speakers who advertise Content-
   URIs with a specific namespace MUST implement a well-defined
   mechanism and protocol to retrieve content within this namespace.
   For example, the "ccn:" namespace indicates a CCN content prefix, but
   this also implies that the (re-)originator of this BGP advertisement
   will be able to receive an Interest message for matching content, and
   either return the content from local storage, or forward the interest
   upstream towards the origin of the content.  If a BGP speaker
   publishes a Content-URI with a NDN namespace, it must:

   1.  Support NDN forwarding

   2.  Be prepared to receive an NDN interest matching this prefix, on
       the address indicated in NEXT_HOP

   3.  Be able to either locally return the matching data packet, or
       forward the interest upstream

   An NDN router receiving a BGP update with a NDN Content-URI
   advertisement uses this update to populate its FIB with a route for
   that prefix pointing towards the face.  Note that NDN BGP speakers
   must also have faces congruent with their addressing.  Hence, it is a
   requirement for all BGP speakers issuing NDN Content-URIs that they

Internet-Draft            BGP URI advertisement                July 2012


   have functional NDN faces on all addresses included in NEXT_HOPs.

   NDN prefixes are matched in entirety


5.  BGP Details

   The following BGP details should be taken into account during
   implementaition

   Origination: A BGP speaker can originate a Content-URI NLRI if and
   only if:

   1.  It understands the scheme or namespace of the URI

   2.  It implements a well-known standard for transferring this type of
       content to a requestor

   3.  Stores the content locally or know a path (external or internal)
       to locate this content.

   Nodes can re-originate BGP advertisements at any time; typically
   because of receiving an advertisement from another remote node in the
   chain or importing an equivalent route from another routing protocol
   or routing domain; however, all the conditions above will apply.

   Nodes can forward BGP advertisements (without rewriting NEXT_HOP)
   which do not satisfy these requirements (e.g. unknown or unsupported
   scheme/namespace).  However, reachability to NEXT_HOP can become an
   issue and network administrators SHOULD deploy additional routes to
   avoid blackholes.

5.1.  Route Selection

   Adj-Rib-Out selection of Content-URI routes follows the same rules as
   selection for IPv4 routes.  Two Content-URI NLRIs are identical for
   selection purposes if the URI strings in both of them are identical.
   The URL scheme or URN namespace MUST be included in the comparison.
   All URIs MUST contain

   Routers MAY implement sophisticated policy rules to enable route
   selection.  This includes aggregate route generation policies,
   although note the same issues with "prefix holes" existing in IPv4
   aggregation also apply to Content-URI.  Aggregate route generation
   MUST only remove entire components and aggregate on token boundaries
   ('/').  Aggregate routes MAY be rewritten arbitrarily by policy, as
   in any BGP implementation.




Narayanan, et al.       Expires January 29, 2013                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            BGP URI advertisement                July 2012


   Local-Rib construction from Content-URI advertisements is more
   flexible than for IP and is left to the implementation.  For example,
   the Local-Fib can contain multiple overlapping routes.  This allows
   implementations to deploy sophisticated forwarding strategies.  Note
   that loop detection MUST be a part of any implementation that
   attempts to implement these forwarding strategies.  Schemes like HTTP
   CDNs and NDN already implement loop detection intrinsically.

5.2.  Usage Scope

   Content-URI advertisements may be shared across IBGP or EBGP
   sessions.  Note that the scalability of large-scale Content-URI
   deployment in the Internet has not been evaluated.  Hence,
   deployments SHOULD restrict Content-URIs within their administrative
   boundaries where the number of URIs exported is managed wthin
   scalability limits of BGP.  To this end:

   1.  Content-URI advertisements MUST NOT be advertised to a BGP peer
       who does not signal the CONTENT_URI_CAP capability.  This acts as
       a natural filter preventing these advertisements from flooding
       Internet routers

   2.  Content-URI advertisements SHOULD carry the "no-export" community
       string to restrict advertisements across EBGP.  However, if a
       network operator wishes to deploy Content-URI across AS
       boundaries within their administrative purview, they MUST deploy
       appropriate filtering such that Content-URI advertisements do not
       travel outside their administrative purview.


6.  Content-URI MP-BGP Encodings

   This section describes the Content-URI MP-BGP messages with their
   attributes and NLRI encodings details.

6.1.  Content-URI Attributes

   We uses standard BGP attributes in Content-URI advertisements:

      NEXT_HOP: Identifies the address that provides reachability to
      this content prefix.  Note that the mechanism to retrieve this
      content is inferred from the URI scheme/namespace.

      ORIGIN, AS_PATH: Same behaviour as RFC4271

      MED, LOCAL_PREF: Same behaviour as RFC4271

      ATOMIC_AGGREGATE: Not used

6.2.  Content-URI NLRI

   Multiprotocol-BGP defines two attributes, MP_REACH and MP_UNREACH,
   that are BGP's containers for carrying opaque information.  Each
   Content-URI NLRI describes a (reachable or unreachable) route to
   content prefix.

   All Content-URI NLRIs MUST be encoded using AFI TBD (Content-URI)
   with SAFI TBD.

   In order for two BGP speakers to exchange Content-URI NLRI, they MUST
   use BGP Capabilities Advertisement to ensure that they both are
   capable of properly processing Content-URI NLRI.  This is done as
   specified in [RFC4760], by using capability code 1 (multi-protocol
   BGP), with the AFI: TBD (Content-URI).

7.  IANA Considerations

   A new Address Family type for Content-URI will be required.  A new
   Subsequent Address Family type for Content-URI will also be required.
