                Forwarding-Label support in CCN Protocol
                   draft-ravi-ccn-forwarding-label-01

Abstract

   The objective of this proposal is to enable ID/Locator split in CCN
   protocol.  We enable this through the notion of forwarding-label (FL)
   object, which is an optional hop-by-hop payload in the Interest
   message with locator name which identifies a network domain, router,
   or a host.  Depending on the application and trust context FL object
   is subjected to policy based actions by the forwarders such as
   invoking security verification or enabling other service-centric
   actions such as FL object replacement.  FL can be inserted by the
   applications or by the network.  To enable dynamic name resolution FL
   can be modified in the network by designated points such as the edge
   routers.  Enabling ID/Locator split in CCN has several applications
   such as towards routing optimization, mobility, handling indirections
   in manifests, and routing scalability.

1.  ID/Locator Split in CCN

   We discuss here the motivations behind the need for separation
   between persistent name (ID) and a locator (LID) in the Interest
   message in the context of CCN and a proposal to achieve this.  The
   advantages of ID/Locator has been extensively studied and has been
   part of many host-centric protocols such as HIP[2], ILNP [3], and
   LISP [4] and also is part of FIA architectures such as
   MobilityFirst[13].  Specifically in CCN, ID based routing is not
   efficient considering dynamic replication of content, mobile
   entities, or address the problem of routing scalability [9] issue,
   hence providing this distinct separation in the protocol offers the
   following advantages:

   o  ID and Locator namespaces are managed by different entities.  IDs
      are managed by applications, hence relevant only to consumers ,

      producers and intermediate service points, while locator names are
      managed by network administrator.  Locators map to network domains
      or specific network element through which the named entity is
      reacheable.  The relationship between the two is established
      during the publishing phase, and managed by a separate name
      resolution function.  ID/Locator distinction in CCN allows
      applications to manage its own name space and not be restricted by
      network naming rules.

   o  Today, CCN Applications bind to persistent IDs, while its
      resolution is handled by per-hop name-based routing in CCN
      forwarder using unicast/anycast/broadcast means, with routing
      scalability linked to name aggregation.  This model has issue when
      the named entity is mobile, migrated, or replicated, as the names
      have to be announced in the routing control plane introducing
      instability and churn.  Enabling ID/Locator split and managing
      this mapping in a separate name resolution system shall address
      the routing churn introduced by dynamic entities.  CCN is unique
      in the sense that both name-based routing and resolution system
      can operate simultaneously driven by its use based on a given
      context, for e.g. while inter-domain routing can be handled using
      name resolution system, intra-domain routing can be based on name-
      based routing.

   o  Affording ID/Locator split in an Interest message offers many
      advantages in many network and application functions such as
      towards name resolution optimization, mobility, handling
      indirections in manifests [6], and routing scalability.

   Considering the above requirements, we propose Forwarding-label (FL)
   object which provides flexibility to forward Interests on a name
   other than the one in the Interest message with the ability to modify
   it in the network.  Handling ID/Locator mapping requires a control
   plane infrastructure and appropriate network layer state with
   security functions to avoid malicious usage.  Specific control plane
   or security mechanism of ID/Locator mapping is out of the scope of
   this document as many techniques can be used towards achieving this.
   This draft presents various considerations towards FL management
   (insertion/modification/deletion), processing by a CCN forwarder,
   PIT/CS implications, FL packet format, and security/trust and
   discusses its application in various scenarios.

2.  Forwarding-Label Management

   FL is used in scenarios where routing by Interest name for name
   resolution when dynamic scenarios are considered which include
   replicated content, device mobility, or where scalability challenges
   exist when ID based routing is employed.  FL objects are subjected to

   processing and modification in the network depending specific use
   case scenario.  Following we discuss various aspects of FL related to
   its semantics and management.

2.1.  FL Naming

   FL are container objects which include LID, service specific
   metadata, and security attributes for authentication.  LIDs are
   hierarchically structured topologically names where the names follow
   the definition in [1].  The security attributes are optional and may
   include validation payload and algorithm as discussed in [1].

2.2.  FL Insertion

   A FL object can be inserted in an Interest message by the consuming
   application or by the network.

   In general in CCN, applications requests a service or content by ID,
   which is feasible today due to the aggregatable nature of ID.  But in
   certain situations, the application logic may use a FL object in
   addition to the ID in the Interest message or this action may also be
   triggered because of feedback from the network on failing to route
   the Interest message based on ID . Networks which processes traffic
   from applications outside its trust domain require a way to validate
   the FL object, one of which is discussed in [9].  Another possibility
   is that networks may ignore FL object from untrusted applications and
   only choose to route by the Interest ID.

   This FL object insertion can also be triggered at the ingress points
   of a network domain.  Network inserts a FL to an incoming Interest
   message if the Interest message satisfies flow service profiles
   imposed by the network administrator in the ingress routers, these
   services functions include mobility or special handling for content
   distribution.  These service profile matching actions include
   matching Interest name to service prefixes or triggered by certain
   marking in the Interest message.  FL object inserted within trust
   domain require may not require security validation.

   In situations where a forwarder handles both these scenarios,
   policies can be applied in the ingress router to handle the two cases
   appropriately.  These policies include the face on which the
   Interests arrives on, Interest ID etc.

2.3.  FL Swapping

   One FL object can be swapped by another in the network in the context
   of a given service by designated points in the network.  As FL
   objects carry a LID, and with appropriate representation and security



Ravindran & Chakraborti  Expires April 22, 2016                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       Forwarding-label support in CCN        October 2015


   considerations in the Interest message, FL objects also can be
   potentially stacked if the Interest message has to be tunneled
   through a domain where routing based on the current FL object is not
   applicable.

2.4.  FL Termination

   FL objects are terminated by a forwarder when the LID in it matches
   its own set of names, here we assume a forwarder could have many LIDs
   such as domain-ID or router-ID.  For e.g. a forwarder in a domain
   identified as /att/santaclara can process FL object with LID set to
   this domain name or forwarder ID such as /att/santaclara/pop-x.
   Whenever a FL object is terminated by the forwarder, depending on the
   service context, it can attach a new FL object, or conduct processing
   based on the Interest ID.

3.  FL Message Format

   As FL object is swappable in the network, hence it is proposed as a
   hop-by-hop field in the optional body of the fixed header as shown in
   Figure 1.  The optional FL container includes attribute of type
   T_LID_NAME, where the LID (Figure 2) are hierarchically structured
   variable length ID [1].  A LID implies an locator such as an AS-,
   Gateway-, Router- or Host- ID.  In addition to the LID, optional FL
   metadata includes information on the application or service context
   to aid network to invoke appropriate FL processing, such as trust
   validation of the FL object.  Optional security attributes such as
   authentication information can be included depending on specific use
   case scenarios, such as secure name delegation information discussed
   in [9], or signature of the consumer.

4.  Forwarding Label Processing Rules

   The following discussion is based on the assumption that all
   forwarders must process optional header fields.  In the context of
   CCN packet processing, FL object is relevant when the decision to
   forward the Interest message is to be made.  At this stage, multiple
   options exist, assuming consistency of policy across the domain: 1)
   in a simpler scenario the rule may be that if a FL is included in an
   Interest message, then it should be given preference to the Interest
   name.  This is under the assumption that FL objects are trusted
   indirections included in the Interest message, which can be validated
   by the router if required; 2) in another scenario the forwarder could
   prioritize forwarding on the ID, and then forward on the LID at every
   hop; 3) in scenario where policy based routing is involved, more
   complex routing approaches can be considered at the network edge,
   such as the forwarder could apply service policy on the Interest ID



Ravindran & Chakraborti  Expires April 22, 2016                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       Forwarding-label support in CCN        October 2015


   and choose to remove or swap with a new FL object irrespective of the
   FL object inserted in the Interest message, while the core nodes
   could use more simpler approach 1 or 2.  Following are the steps when
   approach 1 is applied.

   o  During Interest packet processing when the forwarding decision is
      being made, if a LID is available then it should be preferred to
      the name in the Interest message for forwarding irrespective of
      feasibility of ID based routing.

   o  The validation of the FL depends on trust context.  In trusted
      scenarios where the applications and network are managed by the
      same authority the forwarder can bypass validation.  In untrusted
      scenarios the edge router may validate the FL send from the
      sender, and to avoid re-checks by successive forwarders these
      Interests can be marked to have been validated at the ingress
      point.

   o  If the lookup based on LID in the FL object succeeds then two
      possibilities exist: for non-terminating flows i.e. the LID FIB
      lookup results in a next hop and the Interest is forwarded ; for
      terminating flows, LID lookup invokes a service logic wherein the
      service either re-resolves the Interest ID to another LID hence a
      new FL object or removes the current FL object and subjects the
      Interest to regular processing based on the ID in the Interest
      message.

   o  If the FIB lookup based on the LID fails, then the router can try
      to forward it based on the Interest ID.  If the latter fails, then
      the router could raise a error condition and feedback the message
      to the previous hop with appropriate error code.

   o

5.  PIT Processing Implications

   To maintain simplicity of forwarding logic the purpose of FL object
   should be to guide the Interest to the producer or the closest source
   of the content/service, hence only be used for forwarding decision
   and not required for content object processing, however there may be
   usage scenarios where the FL state is required to be saved in the PIT
   and even piggybacked in the content object (CO).

   In scenario when there is no binding between the ID and LID, and
   multiple Interests may arrive with different LID, then the expected
   outcome is to forward all such Interests with unique LID; in this
   case the PIT is required to save the LID along with the Interest ID
   and forward the duplicate Interest.



Ravindran & Chakraborti  Expires April 22, 2016                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       Forwarding-label support in CCN        October 2015


   In another application it may be required to decouple the choice of
   one consumer's LID from another, i.e a secure binding exists between
   the ID and the LID.  In this case, the PIT saves the FL object, and
   the returning CO should piggyback the Interest FL object and match it
   against the pending PIT entry before reverse forwarding.  In case the
   FL object is swapped by intermediate routers, then the CO should be
   updated with the appropriate FL to ensure the PIT match the previous
   hops, these considerations are similar to those elaborated in [12].

6.  Caching Implications

   The considerations here follows from our previous discussion where
   the FL object is piggybacked in the CO as well.  If there is a
   implicit security binding between the Interest ID and the LID then
   the FL object state is piggybacked along with the CO, and should be
   matched against the incoming Interest FL object before the cached
   content object is returned.

7.  Multiple Domain Scenario

   In wide area network scenarios, Interests cross multiple domains.  If
   FL object is only trusted within domain boundaries, then the FL is
   removed before forwarding the Interest to the next domain, which then
   inserts a new forwarding label with associated security attributes at
   the ingress of the next domain.  But if sufficient trust exists
   between domains to use the FL inserted by the previous domain, then
   the intermediate domains could avoid FL processing and use the FL
   passed on by the previous domains.

8.  FL Security

   FL object security is related to the purpose it is used for and the
   control plane mechanism used to manage them.  Depending on the use
   case scenario of the FL appropriate security mechanisms should be
   applied to secure the control and data planes to avoid exploitation
   of this feature.

   Generally, the major threats against the FL approach is to manipulate
   the relationship between the name and the FL.  Such manipulations can
   happen in various scenarios, some of which are listed as follows: (i)
   a malicious interceptor (acting as a publisher) intentionally injects
   incorrect mapping into the name resolution system; (ii) the malicious
   interceptor (between the edge router and the resolution server)
   manipulates the mapping sent back from the name resolution system
   when the edge router queries the mapping system ; (iii) compromised
   intermediate routers maliciously change the FL, e.g., with the wrong
   FL object or out-dated FL object; (iv) untrusted application may
   inject invalid FL object in the Interest message.

Internet-Draft       Forwarding-label support in CCN        October 2015


   Towards network level FL security, appropriate mechanisms should be
   applied to provide mapping provenance, mapping integrity and anti-
   replay attack to address these issues.  The security mechanisms
   applicable to (i) and (ii) are similar to ones applied to secure
   other mapping systems such as LISP [5],DNS[7], (iii) requires new
   security mechanisms, one such way is to enable a domain level trust
   infrastructure so that the mapping between the name and the
   forwarding-label can be authenticated by successive routers.

   In untrusted environments, when FL object is inserted in the Interest
   message from end hosts, appropriate authentication information should
   be included in the FL object to allow ingress routers to optionally
   validate the Interest ID to LID delegation [9].  Further, network
   could enable several policies, such as even to ignore the FL object,
   to handle FL objects from untrusted applications.

9.  Use Case Scenarios

   Here we provide the discussions related to using forwarding-label in
   different scenarios.

9.1.  Handling Producer Mobility

   In this application we discuss the use FL object to handle producer
   mobility using late-binding technique which is discussed in [8].
   Here the mobile entity (ME) registers the persistent names which
   require mobility with its current point-of-attachment (PoA).  The PoA
   then registers the mapping between the name and the PoA's locator in
   its local name resolution system.  Further the domain updates the
   ME's home domain name resolution system with its current domain LID.
   When a correspondent nodes expresses Interest for the name, it is
   first resolved to the current ME domain by the home domain.  When the
   Interest ingresses the domain, it is resolved again to the ME's
   current location.  Further PoA to PoA signaling can be enabled to
   enable seamless forwarding of Interests whenever ME changes its PoA.

9.2.  Manifests

   Manifests [6] may contain indirections to named content objects.  In
   this case, FL object can be used to indicate its location while
   hierarchical or flat name ID map to the named object.

9.3.  Interest Routing Optimization

   Networks which hosts its own or third party content/service can
   benefit from the ability to handle Interest routing logic in its
   domain opportunistically.  When Interests seeking a specific content

   or service ingresses a network domain, the ingress router can
   redirect the Interest to the closest cache point or service location.

9.4.  Routing Scalability

   As discussed in [9], locator based routing can address routing
   scalability as the number of ASs are many orders less than the number
   of information objects.  This reduces the forwarding table in the DFZ
   zone to order of number of AS in the Internet.
