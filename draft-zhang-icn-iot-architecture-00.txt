                  draft-zhang-icn-iot-architecture-00

Abstract

   Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects to
   Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in different
   domains, the current trend is to develop a unified de-fragmented IoT
   platform so that objects can be made accessible to applications
   across organizations and domains.  Towards this goal, quite a few
   proposals have been made to build a unified IoT platform as an
   overlay on top of today's Internet.  Such overlay solutions, however,
   are inadequate to address the important challenges posed by a unified
   IoT system, especially in terms of mobility, scalability, and
   communication reliability, due to the inherent inefficiencies of the
   current Internet.  To address this problem, we propose to build a
   unified IoT platform based on the Information Centric Network (ICN)
   architecture, which we call ICN-IoT.  ICN-IoT leverages the salient
   features of ICN, and thus provides seamless mobility support,
   scalability, and efficient content and service delivery.

   This draft begins by motivating the need for an unified ICN-IoT
   platform to connect heterogenous IoT systems.  We then propose an
   ICN-IoT architecture and middleware components and discuss how it
   supports efficient data discovery, data processing and data
   distribution.  Finally, we show that ICN-IoT efficiently supports
   context-based scenarios, which are very common for many IoT
   applications.

1.  ICN-Centric Unified IoT Platform

   In recent years, the current Internet has become inefficient in
   supporting rapidly emerging Internet use cases, e.g., mobility,
   content retrieval, IoT, context, etc.  As a result, Information
   Centric Networking has been proposed as a future Internet design to
   address these inefficiencies.  ICN has the following main features:
   (1) it identifies a network object (including a mobile device, a
   content, a service, or a context) by its name instead of its IP
   address, (2) a hybrid name/address routing, and (3) a delay-tolerant
   transport.  These features make it easy to realize many in-network

   functions, such as mobility support, multicasting, content caching,
   cloud/edge computing and security.

   Considering these salient features of ICN, we propose to build a
   unified IoT platform using ICN, in which the overlay IoT services are
   only needed for administrative purposes, while the publishing,
   discovery, and delivery of the IoT data/services is directly
   implemented within the ICN network.  Figure 1 shows the proposed ICN-
   centric IoT approach, which is centered around the ICN network
   instead of today's Internet.

1.1.  Strengths of ICN-IoT

   Our proposed ICN-IoT is a network-layer IoT solution, which can
   satisfy the requirements of the open IoT platform discussed in [5]:

   o  Naming.  In ICN-IoT, we assign a unique name to an IoT object, an
      IoT service, or even a context.  These names are persistent
      throughout their scopes.



Zhang, et al.           Expires January 18, 2015                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft       ICN based Architecture for IoT            July 2014


   o  Scalability.  In ICN-IoT, the name resolution is performed at the
      network layer, distributed within the entire network.  Thus, it
      can achieve high degree of scalability exploiting features like
      content locality, local computing, and multicasting.

   o  Resource constraints.  In ICN-IoT, mobile devices only need to
      upload their data to the gateway when some applications subscribe
      to the data.  Thus, it offers a resource-efficient solution.

   o  Local traffic Pattern.  In ICN-IoT, we can easily cache data/
      services in the network, facilitating local communications.

   o  Context-aware communications.  In ICN-IoT, we assign unique names
      to contexts, which are then mapped to the devices that are
      involved in the context by the name resolution service.  The
      support of multicast can greatly ease the communications to these
      devices.

   o  Seamless mobility handling.  In ICN-IoT, ICN's name resolution
      layer allows multiple levels of mobility relying on receiver-
      oriented nature for self-recovery for consumers, to multi-casting
      and late-binding techniques to realize seamless mobility support
      of producing nodes.

   o  Data storage.  In ICN-IoT, data are stored locally, either by the
      mobile device or by the gateway nodes or at service points.  We
      also implement in-network storage/caching [21] to speed up data
      delivery.

   o  Security and privacy.  In ICN-IoT, secure binding between names
      and content instead of IP addresses to identify devices/data/
      services, is inherently more secure allowing pervasive caching.

   o  Communication reliability.  In ICN-IoT, we support seamless
      mobility, which in turn guarantees reliable communications.

   o  Ad hoc and infrastructure mode.  ICN-IoT support both ad-hoc and
      infrastructure modes.

               Figure 2: An Example ICN-IoT Architecture


2.  Proposed ICN-IoT Architecture

   The design of ICN-IoT is to support a scalable, unified IoT
   architecture with tens of billions of devices.  The ICN-IoT
   introduces a unique identifier (UID) for every network object,
   separated from its dynamic access network locations represented by
   network addresses.  The separation of naming and addressing allows
   ICN-IoT to support identity based routing, which provides seamless
   mobility support.  Multicast and anycast can then become a native
   network capability since a UID can be bound to multiple addresses.

   Figure 2 depicts the example ICN-IoT core network architecture.  The
   assumption is that ICN routers have a sizeable storage and a
   computing plane in addition to the basic routing function.  The
   proposed ICN-IoT network includes the following three basic services:

   o  Name Resolution Service (NRS): A core ICN-IoT function that
      maintains mappings between UID to network address (NA).  This can
      be a logically centralized service distributed on all ICN routers.

   o  Hybrid UID/network address routing: An ICN router makes routing
      decisions for UID identified data blocks.  It uses NRS to find the
      network address(s) for a UID.  In case an explicit network address
      cannot be obtained from NRS, it may route based on intermediate

      network address and use "late-biding" from UID to its actual
      network address.

   o  Delay-tolerant network (DTN) transport: An ICN router can deliver
      UID-only identified data blocks from/to a networked object.  The
      transport performs a cache and forward (CNF) style, hop-by-hop
      delivery.  The data block is cached in router storage and forward
      to next hop based on routing decisions.

   o  In addition to baseline services, ICN-IoT assumes there is a name
      assignment service (NAS) chosen by the owner of a networked
      object.  Through the NAS, the owner assigns and publishes a UID
      with its semantic descriptions for his networked object to a
      searchable space, such as google or semantic Linked-data space
      [1].

   In Figure 3, we summarize the ICN-IoT milddleware into three service
   categories: 1) Data Discovery Service, 2) Data Processing Service and
   3) Data (Re)Distribution Service.  These services span both in Ad hoc
   and Infrastructure settings.

   Data Discovery Service: Discovery service allows applications finding
   things/services/data through certain semantic / syntactic resolution.
   In ICN-IoT, each data/service has both a user-readable name with
   certain semantic structures and unique identifiers (UID).  Based on
   the human readable names, the data discovery service can help
   discover the requested data/services.

   Data Processing Service: The data processing service generates new
   knowledge or information through applying knowledge and/or rules on
   existing data.  Data processing can be distributed based on its scope
   and relevance as in the local node, versus edge service routers, or
   in data centers.  Data processing procedures are often defined by the
   applications/services.

               Figure 3: The ICN-IoT Service Middleware


   Data Re-distribution Service: The (re)distribution service delivers
   data from their sources to different locations for better
   accessibility.  These services will be directly supported by the ICN.
   Firstly, ICN can cache data/content on forwarding ICN routers, and
   secondly, these routers will be added to the NRS service so that
   requests for the cached data/content can be forwarded to them, thus
   reducing the data/content retrieval latencies.

   Figure 3 shows how the ICN-IoT middleware services (identified in
   Figure 2) integrated into the ICN infrastructure.  The components of
   the IoT middleware can be described with respect the services
   identified before.

   o  Realizing Data discovery Service.  Two tasks are involved in
      achieving this.  First is a way to name services/content/devices
      of interest within the IoT application scope.  Each network entity
      that is registered at the Name Assignment Service (NAS) has both a
      human readable name and a unique identifier (UID).  The human
      readable name includes semantic key words that characterize the
      entity.  Once the entities are named, applications based on its

      policy requirements make it accessible considering access control
      policies.  To enable accessibility a discovery function is
      required, which is enabled through NAS.  Figure 3 shows an example
      with sensor SID and service CID.  Both SID and CID are published
      to the searchable name space through NAS, which can be efficiently
      discovered later by the applications.

   o  Realizing Data processing Service.  ICN-IoT uses the in-network
      storage and computing capability to cache and execute data
      processing service, such as a context reasoning service,
      traditionally implemented on overlay servers.  Having the context
      reasoning service within the network, however, requires additional
      computing capabilities offered by routers or separate computing
      facilities in the network.  In Figure 3, the service, identified
      by CID, is cached and executed on an ICN router.

   o  Realizing Data (re)distribution Service.  ICN-IoT performs
      distribution or re-distribution of IoT data and service through
      its native support of in-network caching and multicast based on
      identity based routing.

2.1.  ICN-IoT Scenario

   We will use a context-aware IoT application as an example from
   UbiCab[23] to demonstrate how IoT middleware service is enabled
   inside the proposed ICN-IoT core network.  This example is based on
   MobilityFirst architecture [22] which is based on secured names and
   off-path name resolution infrastructure.

   The example is stated as: "James walks on NYC streets and wants to
   find an empty cab closest to his location".  In this example, we
   assume that James and taxi drivers have sensors on their phones,
   providing GPS location information as data.  The context of this
   application is the relative locations of James and taxi drivers.  A
   context service, as an IoT middleware, is needed to bridge sensors
   (providing GPS location) and the application (phone call program)
   automatically.

   We use a linked-data inspired approach to implement the middleware
   service for this location aware context.  First, a company
   GPSlocation.com offers this service at http://GPSlocation.com/
   nearbyCab, implemented in an RDF graph shown in Figure 5.  This
   context service has two attributes to describe itself, tagged as cab
   and location.  A taxi driver can query this RDF graph and joins as a
   member of the service by adding a link to its own URI
   http://NYCcab.com/cab1 in the RDF graph with a predicate "a:member".
   The sensor data, taxi driver's GPS location, is linked to taxi
   driver's URI with a predicate "a:location" and the value is updated

   by his phone periodically.  he database containing this RDF graph
   must be searchable by users in a searchable space, which we refer as
   IoT resource space in Figure 4.

   In ICN-IoT, we also add an additional 3-tuple or triple in the RDF
   graph with a predicate "UID".  CID is assigned to the context service
   and UID_2 is assigned to cab2.

   This context service can also run as an overlay to the Internet.
   Taxi drivers and passengers can directly call the URI of the context
   service to join the membership and get a nearby cab, respectively.
   As an Internet overlay, the location context service is subject to
   longer delay due to demands are overloaded or unbalanced.

   In this example, since the context service is implemented using an
   RDF graph, it can be cached on ICN routers in a similar way to
   caching content.  This RDF graph can be updated by taxi drivers by
   joining membership, current GPS location etc, since the context
   service is UID identified it can be routed efficiently by the ICN
   routers.  The utility of such information is determined by specific
   application requirements.

   The application scenario is comprised of the following steps,
   illustrated by Figure 8.

   o  Name Assignment.  The owner of the context service publishes its
      CID and the service description (RDF graph of Figure 5) through
      ICN-IoT NAS function, running on both service host and routers, to
      a searchable Link-data space.

   o  NRS Update.  When the context service connects to the ICN network,
      the access router calls NRS update to provide a UID to network
      address mapping.

   o  Service Discovery.  Taxi driver or James can find CID through an
      RDF query requesting services with tags "location" and "cab".

   o  Service Request.  Taxi driver makes a service request to CID with
      an RDF query to join the service membership.

   o  Routing and GNRS Lookup.  The service request toward CID is routed
      to the NA_c, obtained from a NRS lookup.

   o  Service Request Redirection.  James makes a service request to CID
      with an RDF query to match GPS location to a nearby taxi.  James'
      request to CID is redirected to UID_2, the driver of cab2.

   Note that in this example, no CDN overlay is needed to support multi-
   homing, multicasting for a location context service because these are
   embedded in the ICN core network.

   As usual, the benefit of caching is more significant for location
   dependent services.  In our example, it is best to have the
   middleware service being offered at a server close to taxi drivers
   and passengers so that the traffic can be localized with lower
   latency.

   Traditionally, a service provider has to buy edge computing service
   from content distribution network (CDN); recently, cloud computing
   offers another alternative to deploy a distributed service.  The
   native support of caching in ICN provides with the ability to
   distribute a service directly through core network routers.  This
   option may not be suitable for heavyweight service requiring a high
   end web server.  Nevertheless, it could be particularly useful for
   lightweight IoT middleware service.  As shown in our example, when
   the context service is implemented in an RDF graph, caching a service
   is as simple as caching a data and service processing is as simple as



Zhang, et al.           Expires January 18, 2015               [Page 11]

   a database query.  The algorithms behind cache replacement can also
   be similar to what for data caching.

   Once, for example, the service CID is cached, any request to CID is
   intercepted by the ICN router.  In our example, when it is a request
   from taxi driver, it must contain an RDF query requesting either join
   membership or an updated GPS location.  The computing layer of ICN
   router runs a SPARQL engine to interpret the RDF query and makes a
   corresponding database operation.  When it is a request from James, a
   passenger, it must contain an RDF query containing its own GPS
   location and looking for the ID of a taxi with a GPS location nearby.

   Another benefit of ICN caching is that there is no need for end-to-
   end connectivity between the requester and the location context
   server, if the service is currently cached in an accessible ICN
   router.  This is especially useful for ad-hoc or DTN use cases, where
   the application network can be dynamically formed and isolated for a
   period of time.

   This UbiCab example has low data rate.  Next imagine a context
   service requires high data rate, for example, a person wants to see
   snapshots of the street nearby.  And these snapshots are uploaded by
   the people on the street.  Assuming every access network can get
   enough number of people uploading pictures, it is best for the
   network operator to cache the pictures as close to edge as possible.

   Through this location context service example, we can see ICN-IoT
   offers significant native supports for IoT data and services to be
   visible, routable, cacheable and executable in the core network of
   future Internet architecture.

3.  ICN-IoT Deployment

3.1.  Overlay Mode

   As discussed in [5], a host-centric overlay is not able to match the
   inherent information centric nature of IoT systems.  As a
   consequence, this class of solution cannot effectively fulfill
   requirements presented in [5].  At the same time, the state of the
   art is currently investigating ICN-overlays in M2M systems in order
   to ensure interoperability with IP networks [6][7].  As a matter of
   fact, it is unlike that IP will be abruptly switched off, so that
   novel ICN-IoT architectures should be able to provide their
   functionalities also in those environments where IP and ICN routers
   coexist.  In this direction, a noticeable example is provided in [7],
   demonstrating that ICN primitives can increase the scalability, fault
   tolerance, and flexibility of current host centric IoT-overlays.
