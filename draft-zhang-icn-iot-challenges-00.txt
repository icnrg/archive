      ICN based Architecture for IoT - Requirements and Challenges
                   draft-zhang-icn-iot-challenges-00

Abstract

   Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects to
   Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in different
   domains, the current trend is to develop a unified de-fragmented IoT
   platform so that objects can be made accessible to applications
   across organizations and domains.  Towards this goal, quite a few
   proposals have been made to build a unified IoT platform as an
   overlay on top of today's Internet.  Such overlay solutions, however,
   are inadequate to address the important challenges posed by a unified
   IoT system, especially in terms of mobility, scalability, and
   communication reliability, due to the inherent inefficiencies of the
   current Internet.  To address this problem, we propose to build a
   unified IoT platform based on the Information Centric Network (ICN)
   architecture, which we call ICN-IoT.  ICN-IoT leverages the salient
   features of ICN, and thus provides seamless mobility support,
   scalability, and efficient content and service delivery.

   This draft sets the IoT requirement and ICN challenges to realize an
   unified ICN-IoT framework.  Towards this, we first identify a list of
   important requirements which an unified IoT architecture should have
   to support tens of billions of objects.  Then we analyze the current
   state of art deployment model and discuss popular IoT scenarios as in
   smart homes, smart campus, smart grid, smart transportation, and
   smart healthcare.  Though we see most of these requirements are part
   of an ICN design, we discuss specific challenges ICN has to address
   to satisfy them considering heterogeneity in IoT environments.

1.  IoT Motivation and Challenges

   During the past decade, many standalone Internet of Things (IoT)
   systems have been developed and deployed in different domains [4].
   The recent trend, however, is to evolve towards a globally unified
   IoT platform, in which billions of objects connect to the Internet,
   available for interactions among themselves, as well as interactions
   with many different applications across boundaries of administration
   and domains.  Building a unified IoT platform, however, poses great
   challenges on the underlying network and systems.  To name a few, it
   needs to support 50-100 Billion networked objects [1], many of which
   are mobile.  The objects will have extremely heterogeneous means of
   connecting to the Internet, often with severe resource constraints.
   Interactions between the applications and objects are often real-time
   and dynamic, requiring strong security and privacy protections.Before
   we present our solution to such a unified platform, we first describe
   a few popular IoT scenarios to motivate this proposal.

2.  IoT Requirements

   A unified IoT platform has to support interactions among a large
   number of mobile devices across the boundaries of organizations and
   domains.  As a result, it naturally poses stringent requirements in
   every aspect of the system design.  Below, we outline a few important
   requirements that a unified IoT platform has to address.

Internet-Draft       ICN based Architecture for IoT            July 2014


2.1.  Naming

   The first step towards realizing a unified IoT platform is the
   ability to assign names that are unique within the scope/lifetime of
   each device, data items generated by these devices, or a group of
   devices.  Naming has the following requirements.  First, names need
   to be application-centric, i.e., solely serving the purpose of an
   application or service.  Second, names need to be persistent against
   dynamic attributes that are common in IoT systems, such as mobility
   or migration.  Third, names may need to be secure based on
   application requirement.

2.2.  Scalability

   Cisco predicts there will be around 50 Billion IoT devices such as
   sensors, RFID tags, and actuators, on the Internet by 2020 [1].  As
   mentioned above, a unified IoT platform needs to name every
   informational entity such as data, devices, etc.  To deal with
   scalability, the name-locator separation is the basic requirement,
   implying that it is necessary to have a name resolution service.  The
   requirement on such a resolution service is thus clear: the system
   should be able to insert/update/look up a name within a short
   latency.  To satisfy this requirement, decentralization of the name
   resolution is the key.

2.3.  Resource Constraints

   IoT devices can be broadly classified into two groups: resource-
   sufficient and resource-constrained.  In general, there are the
   following types of resources: power, computing, storage, and
   bandwidth.

   Power constraints of the IoT devices limit how much data these
   devices can communicate, as it has been shown that communications
   consume more power than other activities for embedded devices.
   Flexible techniques to collect the relevant information are required,
   and uploading every single produced data to a central server is
   undesirable.  Computing constraints limit the type and amount of
   processing these devices can perform, also information needs to be
   available where it is more likely to be consumed.  As a result, more
   complex processing needs to be conducted elsewhere, example at the
   network edge, which makes it important to balance local computation
   versus communication.

   Storage constraints of the IoT devices limit the amount of data that
   can be stored on the devices.  This constraint means that unused
   sensor data may need to be discarded from time to time.  Bandwidth
   constraints of the IoT devices limit the amount of communication



Zhang, et al.           Expires January 18, 2015                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       ICN based Architecture for IoT            July 2014


   these devices can have, which will have the same implication on the
   system architecture as the power constraints; namely, we cannot
   afford to communicate with every single sensor data generated by the
   device.

2.4.  Traffic Characteristics

   IoT traffic can be broadly classified into local area traffic and
   wide area traffic.  Local area traffic is between nearby devices.
   For example, neighboring cars may work together to detect potential
   hazards on the highway, sensors deployed in the same room may
   collaborate to determine how to adjust the heating level in the room.
   These local area communications often involve data aggregation and
   filtering, have real time constraints, and require fast device/data/
   service discovery and association.  At the same time, the IoT
   platform has to also support wide area communications.  For example,
   commuters can find out real-time traffic and road information and
   then decide which commuting route to take.  Wide area communications
   require efficient data/service discovery and resolution services.

   While traffic characteristics for different IoT systems are expected
   to different, certain IoT systems have been analyzed and shown to
   have comparable uplink and downlink traffic volume in some
   applications such as [18], which means that we have to optimize the
   bandwidth/energy consumption in both directions.  Further, IoT
   traffic demonstrates certain periodicity and burstiness [18].  As a
   result, when provisioning the system, peak traffic volume has to be
   considered.

2.5.  Contextual Communication

   Many IoT applications shall rely on contextual information such as
   social, grouping, location, type of ecosystem (home, grid, transport
   etc.) of devices and data (which are referred to as contexts in this
   document) to initiate dynamic relationship and communication.  For
   example, cars travelling on the highway may form a "cluster" based
   upon their temporal physical proximity as well as the detection of
   the same event.  These temporary groups are referred to as contexts.
   IoT applications need to support interactions among the members of a
   context, as well as interactions across contexts.

   Temporal context can be broadly categorized into two classes, long-
   term contexts such as those that are based upon social contacts as
   well as stationary physical locations (e.g., sensors in a car/
   building), and short-term contexts such as those that are based upon
   temporary proximity (e.g., all taxicabs within half a mile of the
   Time Square at noon on Oct 1, 2013).  Between these two classes,




Zhang, et al.           Expires January 18, 2015                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       ICN based Architecture for IoT            July 2014


   short-term contexts are more challenging to support, requiring fast
   formation, update, lookup and association of these contexts.

2.6.  Handling Mobility

   Mobility in the IoT platform can mean 1) the data producer mobility
   (i.e., location change), 2) the data consumer mobility, 3) IoT
   Network mobility; and 3) disconnection between the data source and
   destination pair (e.g., due to unreliable wireless links).  The
   requirement on mobility support is to be able to deliver IoT data
   below an application acceptable delay constraint in all of the above
   three cases.

   There are varying degrees of mobility in a unified IoT platform,
   ranging from static as in fixed assets to highly dynamic in vehicle-
   to-vehicle environments.

2.7.  Storage and Caching

   Storage and caching plays a very significant role depending on the
   type of IoT ecosystem with the fact that data generated is also
   subjected to privacy and security guidelines.  In a unified IoT
   platform, depending on content caching requirements can be cached at
   will or at service authorized points, and thus we don't need to
   always forward a content request to its original creator.  Rather,
   locating and receiving a cached copy is sufficient for IoT
   applications.  This optimization can greatly reduce the content
   access latencies.

   In network storage and caching, however, has the following
   requirements on the IoT platform.  First, the platform needs to
   support the efficient resolution of cached copies.  Second, certain
   content should not be cached anywhere, and the service platform
   should be able to enforce this.  Third, the platform should strive
   for the balance between caching, content security/privacy, and
   regulations.

2.8.  Security and Privacy

   The unified IoT platform makes physical objects accessible to
   applications across organizations and domains, and security and
   privacy thus become a serious concern.  Security includes data
   integrity, authentication, trust management, and access control at
   different layers of the IoT platform.  Privacy means that both the
   content and the context around IoT data need to be protected.  These
   requirements will be driven by various stake holders such as
   industry, government, consumers etc.

Internet-Draft       ICN based Architecture for IoT            July 2014


2.9.  Communication Reliability

   IoT applications can be broadly categorized into mission critical and
   non-mission critical.  For mission critical applications, reliable
   communication is one of the most important features as these
   applications have strong QoS requirements.  Reliable communication
   requires the following capabilities for the underlying system: (1)
   seamless mobility support to support for extreme disruptions (DTN),
   (2) efficient routing in the presence of intermittent disconnection,
   and (3) QoS aware routing.

2.10.  Self-Organization

   The unified IoT platform should be able to self-organize to meet
   various application requirements, especially the capability to
   quickly discover heterogeneous and relevant devices/data/services
   based on the context.  This discovery can be achieved through an
   efficient platform-wide publish-subscribe service, or through private
   community grouping/clustering based upon trust and other security
   requirements.  In the former case, the publish-subscribe service must
   be efficiently implemented, able to support seamless mobility, in-
   network caching, name-based routing, etc.  In the latter case, the
   IoT platform needs to discover the private community groups/clusters
   efficiently.

2.11.  Ad hoc and Infrastructure Mode

   Depending upon whether there is communication infrastructure, an IoT
   system can be classified as either ad-hoc or infrastructure mode.
   For example, a vehicle may determine to report its location and
   status information to a server periodically through cellular
   connection, or, a group of vehicles may form an ad-hoc network that
   collectively detect road conditions around them.  In the cases where
   infrastructure is unavailable, one of the participating nodes may
   choose to become the temporary gateway.  The open IoT platform needs
   to be able to handle both situations.

   The unified IoT platform needs to design a common protocol that
   serves both modes.  Such a protocol should be able to provide: (1)
   energy-efficient topology discovery and data forwarding in the ad-hoc
   mode, and (2) scalable name resolution in the infrastructure mode.

2.12.  Open API

   General IoT applications involve sensing, processing, and secure
   content distribution occuring at various timescales depending on the
   application requirements.  This requires open APIs to be generic




Zhang, et al.           Expires January 18, 2015                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       ICN based Architecture for IoT            July 2014


   enough to support Pull, Push, and support Pub/Sub mode of interaction
   between consumers, content producer, and IoT services.

3.  State of Art

   Over the years, many stand-alone IoT systems have been deployed in
   various domains.  These systems usually adopt a vertical silo
   architecture and support a small set of pre-designated applications.
   A recent trend, however, is to move away from this approach, towards
   a unified IoT platform in which the existing silo IoT systems, as
   well as new systems that are rapidly deployed, will make their data
   and services accessible to general Internet applications (as in ETSI-
   M2M and oneM2M standards).  In such a unified platform, physical
   world resources can be accessed over Internet and shared across the
   boundaries of physical, enterprise and application.  However, current
   approaches to achieving this objective are based upon Internet
   overlays, whose inherent inefficiencies hinders the platform from
   satisfying the IoT requirements outlined earlier (particularly in
   terms of scalability, security, mobility, and self-organization)

        Figure 1:Silo architecture of standalone IoT systems


   A typical standalone IoT system is illustrated in Figure 1, which
   includes devices, a gateway, a server and applications.  Many IoT
   devices have limited power and computing resources, unable to
   directly run normal IP access network (Ethernet, WIFI, 3G/LTE etc.)
   protocols.  Therefore, we use the IoT gateway to connect these
   devices to the server.  Through the IoT server, applications can
   subscribe to the data collected by the devices, or interact with the
   devices.

Internet-Draft       ICN based Architecture for IoT            July 2014


   There have been quite a few popular protocols for standalone IoT
   systems, such as DF-1, MelsecNet, Honeywell SDS, BACnet, etc.
   However, these protocols are host-driven, instead of information
   driven, leading to a highly fragmented protocol space with limited
   interoperability.

3.2.  Overlay Based Unified IoT Solutions

   The current approach to a unified IoT platform is to make IoT
   gateways and servers adopt standard APIs.  IoT devices connect to the
   Internet through the standard APIs and IoT applications subscribe and
   receive data through standard control and data APIs.  Building on top
   of today's Internet as an overlay, this is the most practical
   approach towards a unified IoT platform.  There are ongoing
   standardization efforts including ETSI[19], oneM2M[20] CORE[21].
   Network operators can use standard API to build common IOT gateways
   and servers for their customers.  Figure 2 shows the architecture
   adopted in this approach.

3.2.1.  Weaknesses of the Overlay-based Approach

   The above overlay-based approach can work with many different
   protocols, but the system is not designed in a holistic manner.
   Another limiting factor is that it is built upon today's IP network,
   which has a few inherent weaknesses towards supporting a unified IoT



Zhang, et al.           Expires January 18, 2015                [Page 9]

   system.  As a result, it cannot satisfy some of the requirements we
   outlined in Section 2:

   o  Naming.  In current overlays for IoT systems the naming scheme is
      host centric, i.e., the name of a given resource/service is linked
      to the one of device that can provide it.  In turn, device names
      are coupled to IP addresses, which are not persistent in mobile
      scenarios.  On the other side, in IoT systems the same service/
      resource could be provided by many different devices thus
      requiring a different design rationale.

   o  Scalability.  The overlay-based approach uses IP addresses as
      names at the network layer, which does not provide the scalability
      needed to support device/service mobility or flexible name
      resolution.

   o  Resource constraints.  The overlay-based approach requires every
      device to send data to the IoT server.  Resource constraints of
      the IoT devices, especially in power and bandwidth, will seriously
      limit the performance of this approach.

   o  Traffic Characteristics.  In this approach, applications are
      written in a host-centric manner suitable for point-to-point
      communcation.  IoT requires support for multicasting that is
      challenging the underlying for overlay systems today.

   o  Contextual Communications.  This overlay-based approach cannot
      react to dynamic contextual changes in a timely fashion.  The main
      reason is that context lists are kept at the IoT server in this
      approach, and they cannot help efficiently route requests/
      information at the network layer.

   o  Mobility.  The overlay-based approach cannot seamlessly support
      device mobility.  In this approach, communications are IP driven,
      which is inefficient for mobility support.

   o  Storage and Caching.  The overlay-based approach does not provide
      efficient in-network storage and caching support.  Also,
      applications are written in a host-centric manner, wherein network
      requests are bound to a specific destination host/server instead
      of a specific piece of content.

   o  Communication Reliability.  The overlay-based approach offers
      insufficient communication reliability when the devices/services/
      data are mobile.

Internet-Draft       ICN based Architecture for IoT            July 2014


   o  Self-Organization.  The overlay-based approach is topology-based
      as it is bound to IP semantics, and thus does not sufficiently
      satisfy the self-organization requirement.

   o  Ad-hoc and infrastructure mode.  As mentioned above, the overlay-
      based approach lacks self-organization, and thus does not provide
      efficient support for the ad-hoc mode.

4.  Popular Scenarios and Challenges

   Several types of IoT applications exists, where the goal is efficient
   and secure management and communication among objects in the system
   and with the physical world through sensors, RFIDs and other devices.
   Below we list a few popular IoT applications.

4.1.  Smart Homes

   Home [10] is a complex ecosystem for smart systems such as climate
   control, home security monitoring, smoke detection, or smart meters.
   In a unified IoT platform, we would inter-connect these systems
   through the Internet, such that they can interact with each other and
   make decisions at an aggregated level.  Also, the systems can be
   accessed and manipulated remotely.  The challenges for smart home
   include topology independent service discovery, common protocol for
   heterogeneous device/application/service interaction, policy based
   routing/forwarding, service mobility as well as privacy protection.

   Smart home [2][6] faces the following challenges that are hard to
   address with IP-based overlay solutions: (1) context-aware control: a
   smart home system must make decisions (e.g., decisions on how to
   control, decisions on when to collect data, decisions on where to
   carry out computation, etc.) based upon the contextual information
   [3]; (2) inter-operatibility: a smart home system must operate with
   devices that adopt heterogeneous naming, communication, and control
   systems; (3) mobility: a smart home system must deal with mobility
   caused by the movement of sensors or data receivers; (4) security: a
   smart home system must be able to deal with foreign devices.

4.2.  Smart Campus

   Increasing number of campuses [7] are equipped with sensing and
   communication devices, inside enterprise or classroom buildings, at
   stadium, on parking lots, on school buses, etc.  A unified IoT
   platform can tightly integrate different parts of campus life, and
   thus enable many IoT applications that can benefit a large body of
   enterprise affiliates.  The challenges in smart campus include
   efficient and secure device/data/resource discovery, inter-

   operability between different control systems, throughput scaling
   with number of devices, and unreliable communication due to mobility.

   Smart campus [7] faces the following challenges that are hard to
   address with IP-based overlay solutions: (1) efficient device/data/
   resource discovery: a smart campus system must be able to quickly
   discover requested device, data, or resources; (2) scalability: a
   smart campus system must be able to scale efficiently with the number
   and type of sensors and devices; (3) mobility: a smart campus system
   must be able to deal with mobility caused by movement of devices.

4.3.  Smart Grid

   Central to smart grid [17]  is data flow and information management,
   achieved by using sensors and actuators, which enables important
   capabilities such as substation and distribution automation.  In a
   unified IoT platform, data collected from different smart grids can
   be integrated to reach more significant optimizations.  The
   challenges for smart grid include reliability, real-time control,
   secure communications, and data privacy.

   Smart grid [11][12]  faces the following challenges that are hard to
   address with IP-based overlay solutions: (1) scalability: a smart
   grid system must be able to scale gracefully to manage a large number
   of heterogeneous devices; (2) real time: a smart grid system must be
   able to perform real-time data collection, data processing and
   control; (3) reliability: a smart grid system must be resilient to
   hardware/software/networking failures; (4) security: a smart grid
   system must be able to defend against malicious attacks.

4.4.  Smart Transportation

   We are currently witnessing the increasing integration of sensors
   into cars and transportation frieghts [13].  Current production cars
   already carry many sensors ranging from rain gauges and
   accelerometers over wheel rotation/traction sensors, to cameras.
   While intended for internal vehicle functions, these could also be
   networked and leveraged for applications such as monitoring external
   traffic/road conditions.  Further, we can build vehicle-to-
   infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications that
   enable many more applications for safety, convenience, entertainment,
   etc.  The challenges for smart transportation include fast
   data/device/service discovery and association, efficient
   communications with mobility, trustworthy data collection and
   exchange.

   Smart transportation [13][14] faces the following challenges that are
   hard to address with IP-based overlay solutions: (1) mobility: a

Internet-Draft       ICN based Architecture for IoT            July 2014


   smart transportation system must deal with a large number of mobile
   nodes; (2) real-time and reliability: a smart transportation system
   must be able to operate on real-time and remain resilient in the
   presence of failures; (3) in-network computing/filtering: a smart
   transportation system will benefit from in-network computing/
   filtering as such operations can reduce the end-to-end latency; (4)
   inter-operatibility: a smart transportation system must operate with
   heterogeneous device and protocols; (5) security: a smart
   transportation system must be resilient to all kinds of malicious
   attacks.

4.5.  Smart Healthcare

   As more embedded medical devices, or devices that can monitor human
   health become increasingly deployed, smart healthcare is becoming a
   viable alternative to traditional healthcare solutions [15].  For
   smart health applications, a unified IoT platform is critical for
   sharing data and enabling timely actuations.  The challenges in smart
   healthcare include real-time interactions, high reliability, short
   communication latencies, trustworthy, security and privacy.

   Smart healthcare [15][16]  faces the following challenges that are
   hard to address with IP-based overlay solutions: (1) real-time and
   reliability: a smart healthcare system must be able to operate on
   real-time and remain resilient in the presence of failures; (2)
   inter-operatibility: a smart healthcare system must operate with
   heterogeneous device and protocols; (3) security: a smart healthcare
   system must be resilient to all kinds of malicious attacks.

5.  ICN Challenges for IoT

   ICN integrates content/service/host abstraction, name-based routing,
   compute, caching/storage as part of the network infrastructure
   connecting consumers and services which meets most of the
   requirements discussed above; however IoT requires special
   considerations given heterogeniety of devices and interfaces such as
   for constrained networking [5], data processing, and content
   distribution models to meet specific application requirements which
   we identify as challenges in this section.

5.1.  Naming

   Information resources generated by sensors is expected to be locally
   and/or globally accessible subjected to access policies and privacy
   requirements.  Hence identifying resources in a local or global
   context applying human readeable, secure, or hybrid means is the
   first step.  Further considerations include self-configuration




Zhang, et al.           Expires January 18, 2015               [Page 13]

   requirements, vendor assigned identifiers, constrained devices, and
   heterogenous environments.  [TBD]

5.2.  Caching

   Distributed caching helps to multicast data to consumers in large
   scale, but its usage differs in constrained and infrastructure part
   of the network.  Caching in constrained networks is limited to small
   amounts in the order of 10KB.  Distributed caching strategies could
   coordinate multiple devices to achieve in-network caching of all the
   chunks for medium-sized content (i.e., of size in the order of n
   kBytes, where n is the number of nodes in the network).  Second, in
   contrast to simple sensor scenarios with a single sink, the IoT
   envisions multiple consumers (e.g. crowd computing).  On the
   infrastructure end caching can be centralized at given service points
   to ensure policy enforcement, or distributed assuming similar policy
   control can be enforced.  [TBD]

5.3.  Name resolution

   Inter-connecting and establishing reacheability to these numerous IoT
   entities requires a scalable name resolution system considering
   several dynamic factors like mobility of end points, service
   replication, failure or migration.  The objective is to achieve
   scalable name resolution handling static and dynamic ICN entities
   with low compelexity and control overhead.  [TBD]

5.4.  Contextual Communication

   Contextualization through metadata in ICN control or application
   payload allows IoT applications to adapt to different environments.
   This enables intelligent networks which are self-configurable and
   enable intelligent networking among consumers and producers.  [TBD]

5.5.  Routing and Forwarding

   The ICN router state required to guide consumers interests to the
   producer(s) or data-response to the consumer should be low.  While
   the unconstrained network can leverage a combination of name-based or
   location based forwarding, resource constrained networks require
   simple routing and forward logic [5].  [TBD]

5.6.  In-network Computing

   Processing sensed data in IoT applications is critical as the data is
   noisy as is, hence integrating computing services into an ICN
   infrastructure is important.  [TBD]

Internet-Draft       ICN based Architecture for IoT            July 2014


5.7.  Energy Efficiency

   This is of critical importance to constrained network segments where
   the battery life is expected to in the order of years, this requires
   ICN control, forwarding overhead to be as low as possible.  [TBD]
   [TBD]

5.8.  Security and Privacy

   This is crucial to IoT applications in general considering the use
   case sceanrios discussed in Section 4.  Though ICN includes data-
   centric security features the mechanisms have to be generic enough to
   satisfy multiplicity of policy requirments for different
   applications.  [TBD]
