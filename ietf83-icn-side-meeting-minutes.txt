---+ ICN Side Meeting @ IETF-83

---++ Summary

The ICN side meeting at IETF-83 in Paris was attended by 53
people. There were four 10 minutes presentations, largely focused on
ICN caching topics, followed by a discussion on next steps towards
forming an IRTF research group. Many people expressed interest in
having such a group. A few people commented on specific objectives
that could be mentioned in a charter for the group, and it was
concluded that such objectives should be added soon so that a group
can be formed and have its first meeting in summer 2012.

---++ Detailed Notes


---+++ Introduction (Börje Ohlman, Dirk Kutscher)

   * http://trac.tools.ietf.org/group/irtf/trac/attachment/wiki/icnrg/ICNRG-sidemeeting-Paris.pdf
   * Note well statement presented
   * Agenda bashing: two presenters were not able to present


---+++  "Route caching: a technique to improve the scalability of ICN" (Andrea Detti, Giacomo Morabito)


   * http://trac.tools.ietf.org/group/irtf/trac/attachment/wiki/icnrg/RouteCachingDettiMorabitoV2.pdf
   * Andrea Detti presenting
   * scenario intro
   * practical issues: routing scalability
   * idea: just store working set of routes in the FIB, leveraging Zipf-based interest distribution
   * Feasibility check: number of active routes in order of 10^3 - 10^4
   * CCNx-based software has been used in testbed -- presentation has reference

   * Questions
      * Thomas Schmidt: IP traces mapped to ICN flows -- how realistic is that? Have you looked at FIB updates? Increase of FIB updates?
         * consider TCP ACK, extract IP dest addr, re-map into domain name, obtain "flow to a name", considering /32 addresses, realistic only this specific scenario
      * Thomas Schmidt: there are many names that map to many address (virtual hosting)
      * Dave Oran: how do you purge stale FIB entries?
         * have not focused on this in paper, lifetime of entry has to be quite short
      * Dave Oran: but that is not built into your efficiency calculations?
         * no

---+++ "ICN caching feasibility and trade-offs" (Diego Perino)

   * http://trac.tools.ietf.org/group/irtf/trac/attachment/wiki/icnrg/20120328_ICNRG_Perino.pdf
   * Challenges in ICN caching
   * packet-level has to run at high speed
   * one infrastructure shared by many applications
   * joint proactive content placement and reactive caching
   * more...
   * Feasibility -- Cache design
   * memory access most important constraint
   * size / access time trade-off
   * analyzing different caching processing probabilities depending on transmission speed (access, edge, core)
   * Storage Mangement Techniques
   * simple cache replacement techniques
   * static vs. dynamic storage management
   * Dynamic: guarantee minimim amount of resource to apps
   * Results: LRU and Storage partition (SP)
   * Static partitioning preserves application performance and can provide guarantee to their users
   * Dynamic management can better utilize resources while controlling application performance and only slightly increasing provider costs


---+++ "A dive into the caching performance of Content Centric Networking" (Dario Rossi)

   * http://trac.tools.ietf.org/group/irtf/trac/attachment/wiki/icnrg/ietf83-rossi-dive-ccn.pdf
   * assumption: chunk-based ICN with interest routing and aggregation
   * how to leverage topology/path knowledge
   * Different forwarding policies
   * strategies for exploiting replica location knowledge
   * some limits for different strategies
   * trying to explore cache neighborhood
   * aim: find closest copy
   * approach: parameter space exploration
   * cache over catalog ration important
   * interest forwarding approach might efficiency heavily
   * proposing comparable performance measurements
   * ccnsim advertisement, open source, c++ with omnet++

---+++ "Information Centric Networking for Virtual Private Community (VPC)" (Myeong-Wuk Jang) 

   * http://trac.tools.ietf.org/group/irtf/trac/attachment/wiki/icnrg/20120328_ICN%20for%20VPC_Myeong.pdf
   * Virtual Private Community scenario (VPC)
   * serverless, secure content sharing platform
   * have developed routing daemon and naming conventions
   * hierarchically naming approach
   * "user-friendly naming"
   * "random" number in name: hash of principal id (??)
   * contextual name discovery
   * routing daemon: VCA
   * CCN dig sig scheme
   * VPC trust model
   * Android prototypes (phones, TVs, PCs)
   * need to make content distribution more efficient (SK operator requirement)
   * different services
   * has been demoed at MWC and elsewhere

---+++ Next Steps (Lars Eggert)

   * had a couple of meetings now
   * always been well-attended
   * today: pretty broad selection of talks, time slot too short
   * question: should be form a RG? what should it be?
   * charter is on Wiki page

   * Comments
      * Volker: short summary of objectives
      * Börje repeating objectives from draft charter
      * Dave Oran: NOMEN ICNRG overlap?
         * Why are people here and not at Infocom?
      * Scott Brim: potential consumer, very interested, want to see RG
      * N.N: overlap with ICN workshop seems larger, so research interest seems to be there
      * Lixia: RG should be more than forum
         * specific targets maybe
         * need more focused objectives
      * Jörg: people probably don't attend Infocom just for NOMEN without having a paper
      * Jörg: love not to have to go to 20+ workshop, don't see risk of explosion
         * RG would fill interesting gap of continuity
         * workshops are normally about individual presentations of results only
         * RG could be a place to have it more organized, may get participation from additional people
      * Lixia: should not do same things here as in academic workshops
      * Martin: should not have objectives for ways of running the group
      * Jörg: best way to find answers is to try
      * Matt: having listened to discussion, it seems what is missing is discussion about charter
      * Lars: requested to operate on technical topics
      * Stephen: supportive of having the RG
         * what group exist that works precisely according to charter?
         * maybe RRG was exception
      * Leslie: Internet impact -- will this be answered?
         * could be a reason to have RG
      * Lars: there is interest -- would IRTF RG would add value?
      * some support & some scepticim
      * proposal: discuss topics on list
      * Dave: if we form an RG, there is benefit to meet at IETF
        * not having experts in Internet tech (routing, sec) close to this would be sub-optimal
      * Lars: summary: run charter discussion on list, leaning towards chartering a group, revisit whether chartering will be correct
